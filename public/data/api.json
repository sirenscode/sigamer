Understaffed and undersupplied, the hospital is the last bastion of hope for countless soldiers on the Western Front. Your main aims are to keep up your team's morale, and support the war effort with the soldiers you have treatedTo do so, you need to manage your hospital to take charge of the flood of injured soldiers brought in after every battle. Make sure to admit the patients in order of priority, before treating them, scheduling surgery or abandoning them to their fate... Resources are limited despite the ever-increasing needs... Learn to adapt to each new situation, taking sometimes morally tough decisions. Decide on improvements to make to your facilities, and use the latest technologies available to military medicine."

      "description":"Although James Cameron's Avatar: The Game is named after the movie, the story itself doesn't follow the plot of the film. Instead the player takes on the role of Lance Corporal Ryder, a signal-specialist who is send to the distant moon Pandora. But Ryder isn't just any other soldier. Instead he or she is one of the selected group of people that take part in the so-called Avatar-program. Avatars are a hybrid of Na'vi DNA and human DNA that have been created in order to better interact with the inhabitants of the planet: the Na'vi, tribe-like and technology-wise not very advanced people that are one with nature. Although the Na'vi are friendly to the new-comers at first, soon the humans want more than just diplomatic relations. They want to relocate the Na'vi in order to be able to strip the planet of its natural resources. A war breaks out which only one side can win - it is up to the player which it will be. Early in the game the player has to decide weather he wants to help the Na'vi unlock the power of the Well of Souls or if he wants to stay with the humans. Depending on his choice, the gameplay changes significantly: * Human: As a human the player can enter buildings, drive vehicles like buggies and helicopters and use full-body armor as well as several different kinds of firearms including shotguns and flamethrowers. In addition Pandora itself is against him meaning both plants and animals will attack the player but will also grant experience points. As a human the player can build pods that replenish ammo and health a specific locations. Na'vi: The Na'vi are more than two meters high and as such can neither enter buildings nor use humans vehicles. But Pandora herself is friendly so plants and animals won't attack (or give experience points for that matter) allowing the player to ride strange horses or fly around on huge dinosaur-like creatures. While the player himself is able to use a machine gun, normally the Na'vi rely on bows and arrows as well as strange swords and staves. If the player manages to pull of a five-hit-combo, a special attack comes available. Na'vi harvest plants in order to get arrows and cell samples."

The Tier 1 Operator functions on a level above and beyond even the most highly trained Special Operations Forces. Their exact numbers, while classified, hover in the low hundreds. They are living, breathing, precision instruments of war. They are experts in the application of violence.

      "description":"Although Spider-Man: Web of Shadows shares some features as previous Spider-Man games there are also many differences including no movie connection for starters. A flashback in the beginning reveals how a fight with Venom causes some symbiote to attach to Spider-Man giving him greater strength. Spider-Man then meets Luke Cage who helps train him to defeat the city gangs. During an attempt to save some gang leaders from assassins, Spider-Man is attacked by residents who are controlled by symbiote. The symbiote substance terrorizes the city as it spreads and attaches to innocent citizens. Spider-Man begins a quest to save New York City. He sees the epidemic sweeping the streets below as he’s able to swing over and between buildings with great speed and agility hunting down baddies. Don’t worry about falling from buildings as Spider-Man seems to be unaffected by the plunge. When under attack, just mashing the X button enables Spider-Man to punch and conquer. The player has the ability to change suits easily where you can defeat bad guys as either the red Spidey using his web or the black Spidey using the tendrils from the symbiote. Other destructive combo attacks are the same regardless of suit color. Choosing one suit color over the other is more of a player’s personal choice for each fight and doesn’t have an impact on the game’s outcome. However, the player will be forced to make decisions during the game that are equal to Spider-Man’s red suit or black suit morals. The choices made at these times will lead the player to different endings based on the paths taken. Points are earned as he fights crime and advances to help upgrade moves and actions."

      "description":"'To save the one you love, rise again and again. Your unyielding spirit becomes your strongest weapon.' An Arabian Nights and Ancient Egyptian civilization-themed Soulslike & Roguelite Action game. In ancient times, a sun-powered priestess brought hope to the people. However, Anubis, the god of the underworld, coveting her radiant power, kidnapped her and imprisoned her in his fortress, the 'Labyrinth of Death.' His aim was to sacrifice the sun priestess to seize the power of the sun god. You, as an assassin sworn to protect the sun priestess, embark on a quest to rescue her from Anubis's stronghold, the 'Labyrinth of Death.' The labyrinth presents various challenges and formidable foes that may defeat you. However, you possess a unique power—the ability to rewind time with the 'Hourglass of Time.' Even if you fail, you can return to the past and repeatedly face new challenges. The true enemy in this game is 'giving up.' No matter how many times you fall or fail to defeat your enemies, as long as you don't give up, new challenges await. The true game over only comes when you stop trying. With a burning resolve and belief in your own strength, save the sun priestess and find true love. Note: The game does not have a save feature for progress. The deeper you go, the greater the pain of defeat. However, those who have not experienced setbacks are those who never dared to challenge."

      "description":"Destroyer: The U-Boat Hunter is an innovative, cross-genre destroyer simulation which truthfully depicts the struggle of escort groups protecting allied convoys against German U-boats during the Battle of the Atlantic. Take full control of a Fletcher-class destroyer, using authentic instruments and attack procedures to fully experience the full spectrum of anti-submarine warfare. Destroyer combines the thrill of commanding an anti-submarine warship with the tactical challenge of managing a whole escort group protecting convoys against relentless wolfpacks.

Whether a military sim veteran or a fledgling captain, immerse yourself in a cinematic naval warfare experience and feel the thrill of the hunt!"

      "description":"Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city."

      "description":"From the depths of darkness, a dragon soars. A new dark fantasy Three Kingdoms action RPG from Team NINJA, the developers of Nioh. 184 AD, Later Han Dynasty China. The land is overcome by chaos and destruction. The imperial dynasty that prospered for many years is now about to collapse. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a dramatic, action-packed story of a nameless militia soldier fighting for survival in a dark fantasy version of the Later Han Dynasty where demons plague the Three Kingdoms. Players fight off deadly creatures and enemy soldiers using swordplay based on the Chinese martial arts, attempting to overcome the odds by awakening the true power from within. Wo Long refers to a crouching dragon, and also refers to a hero or person of greatness who is not yet known. This is the story of officers, who will later become heroes, during their ‘unknown’ period, and also the story of a protagonist’s rise from being a ‘nobody’."

      "description":"Weird West legends meet eldritch horror in BLOOD WEST, an immersive stealth FPS. Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc. The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer. Blood West is a stealth FPS inspired by the genre classics such as the Thief series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, or - from the contemporary catalog - Hunt: Showdown. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?"
